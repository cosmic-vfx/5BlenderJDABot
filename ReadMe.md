Really basic bot, For 5Blender
<hr>
Now allows for heroku, very basic to setup

Heroku Setup:

  First go to IntelliJ and go to `file` > `Project Structure` > `Artifacts` > `[Green +]` > `JAR` > `from modules with dependencies` > `[Folder Icon then find your main class, in this it is called "Bot"]`.
  
  How to build it: `Build` > `Build Artifacts` > `Build`
  
  Then create a github repo[google it to figure it out and make sure its private], then setup heroku account that links to the github, then upload all files from the repo to the github and then upload a new file from: `Project Dir` > `out` > `artifacts` > `NewTestBot_jar` > `NewTestBot.jar`, once uploaded make sure to go back to heroku and click the Deploy button.
  
  MAKE SURE THE JAR IS PLACED IN THE SAME FOLDER DIRECTORY AS THE PROCFILE
